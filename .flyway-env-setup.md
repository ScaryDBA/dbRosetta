# Setting FLYWAY_PASSWORD Environment Variable

## PowerShell (Current Session)
```powershell
$env:FLYWAY_PASSWORD = "cX`$RBy#xja0kJW!Q"
```

## PowerShell (Persistent - Current User)
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("FLYWAY_PASSWORD", "cX`$RBy#xja0kJW!Q", "User")
```

## Verify Environment Variable is Set
```powershell
echo $env:FLYWAY_PASSWORD
```

## For CI/CD Pipelines
Set the `FLYWAY_PASSWORD` as a secure environment variable in your CI/CD system:
- **GitHub Actions**: Repository Secrets
- **Azure DevOps**: Pipeline Variables (with secret flag enabled)
- **GitLab CI**: CI/CD Variables (masked and protected)

**Note**: Never commit passwords to Git. The flyway.toml and flyway.conf files reference `${FLYWAY_PASSWORD}` which will be resolved from the environment at runtime.
