Here's what the AI wants to say about the project:

dbRosetta is focused on practical, battle-tested patterns for schema portability and operational readiness across SQL Server and PostgreSQL; expect reproducible migrations, CI-first validation, and clear restore drills. If you run into issues or want to propose features, open an issue with reproduction steps or a small example repo so maintainers can triage quickly. Contributions that include tests, a changelog entry, and a short justification for breaking changes are prioritized for faster review.
