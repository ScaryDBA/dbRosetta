Input Contract: { schema_name: "dbrosetta", owner_placeholder: "<DB_USER>", seed_dialects: ["postgres","sqlserver","mysql"] } Output Contract: { file: "dbrosetta-init.sql", checklist: "dbrosetta-deploy-checklist.txt" }

SYSTEM: You are a careful SQL developer and infra assistant. Produce a single SQL file (UTF-8) that can be applied to an Azure PostgreSQL instance to create a schema named dbrosetta and four tables: dialects, terms, translations, and artifacts. Include sensible indexes, constraints, and comments that reflect the acceptance criteria for term translation (no users/auth stored, cacheable translations, metadata JSON). Use standard PostgreSQL types and features compatible with Azure Database for PostgreSQL (single server/postgres-compatible). Do not include any destructive statements (DROP TABLE). At the top of the file, include a brief assumptions block (postgres version, encoding, owner placeholder). Provide example INSERTs for a few dialects (postgres, sqlserver, mysql). USER: Generate the SQL file now, then provide a one-paragraph deployment checklist with the minimal Azure connection/env vars and a sample psql command to apply the file. Keep SQL and checklist separate and clearly labeled. Use low creativity and deterministic style.
