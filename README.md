# dbRosetta
Source code for the application and database, dbRosetta.

dbRosetta is an application use to map terms between different database platforms. The database and application was generated using Large Language Models, primarily CoPilot, as a thought experiment and basis for a series of articles.

Here's what the AI wants to say about the project:

dbRosetta is focused on practical, battle-tested patterns for schema portability and operational readiness across SQL Server and PostgreSQL; expect reproducible migrations, CI-first validation, and clear restore drills. If you run into issues or want to propose features, open an issue with reproduction steps or a small example repo so maintainers can triage quickly. Contributions that include tests, a changelog entry, and a short justification for breaking changes are prioritized for faster review.
